# Nexus Intelligence: Autonomous AI Infrastructure Monitor

An enterprise-grade market intelligence engine that tracks, analyzes, and alerts on global AI infrastructure shifts in real-time. Built to demonstrate high-performance web scraping, AI-driven sentiment analysis, and event-driven architecture.

## 🚀 The Mission
Nexus Intelligence automates the surveillance of AI providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) to detect price changes, new GPU availability, and regional expansions before they are officially announced.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ (App Router) with Tailwind CSS for a high-density data dashboard.
- **Backend Automation**: Node.js & Playwright for headless browser surveillance.
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini Pro for heuristic analysis of unstructured provider data.
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for real-time data persistence and subscription management.
- **Communication**: Resend for automated, event-driven email alerts and Discord Webhooks for real-time logging.
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel for the dashboard; GitHub Actions for cron-scheduled autonomous scraping.

## 🏗️ Systems Architecture
- **Autonomous Scrapers**: Playwright bots simulate human behavior to bypass anti-bot measures and capture live data.
- **Intelligence Layer**: Raw data is passed to Gemini AI to filter "noise" from actual market-moving events.
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Supabase Realtime enables the dashboard to update without a page refresh when prices move.
- **Scalable Notification Engine**: A custom subscription logic that maps user preferences to specific provider updates.

## 📈 Featured Skills
- **Full-Stack Engineering**: Integrated complex server-side logic with reactive frontend components.
- **Systems Design**: Implemented a robust "Monorepo" structure with strict security protocols for environment variables.
- **DevOps**: Configured CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions for 24/7 autonomous operations.

## 🔒 Security
Built with **Operational Security (OpSec)** best practices:
- Strict environment variable isolation.
- Service-role restricted database access.
- Secure API routing for client-side interactions.
